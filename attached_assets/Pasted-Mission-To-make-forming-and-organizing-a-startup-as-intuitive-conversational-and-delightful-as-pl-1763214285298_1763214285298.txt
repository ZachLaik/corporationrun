Mission

To make forming and organizing a startup as intuitive, conversational, and delightful as playing a cooperative game — while ensuring every legal step is handled professionally, transparently, and with best-practice templates.

Intent

User should always know what the company knows, what is missing, and what is recommended next.

The AI should behave like a super-friendly, elite startup lawyer.

Every document should go through the same intuitive process:
Draft → Validate → Sign → Activate → Remember.

Founders and investors sign via email & magic-link e-signatures.

Once signed, a document becomes a legal memory of the startup.

The system should make founders feel:
“I understand what’s going on.”
“Everything is under control.”
“This is fun.”

⭐ 2. PRODUCT LAYOUT & NAVIGATION

After initial startup creation, the user can freely navigate between:

1. Overview

Founder cards (status: missing email → invited → signed)

Company health meter

Summary of existing signed docs

"Jurisdiction" selector + tax comparison

2. Founders

Add founders

Assign roles

Proposed equity or vesting

Status of ID upload & signatures

⭐ 3. DOCUMENT FLOW (UNIVERSAL PIPELINE)

Every document follows the same predictable lifecycle:

STEP 1 — Drafting

Triggered by:

User request (“Draft an NDA”)

AI suggestion (“You should create a Pre-Founder Agreement now”)

DocumentAgent for that type:

Loads its template(s)

Extracts data from company state

Asks for missing details via voice or UI forms

Produces the draft

UI shows a Document Card:

Title

Status: Drafting

“Open draft”

“Explain this”

STEP 2 — Validation

AI runs:

Mandatory checks

Missing fields

Role consistency

IP consistency

Investor details sanity

Optional jurisdiction warnings

UI shows:

Validation checklist

Highlighted fields to complete

Summary in plain English

User approves → Move to Signing.

STEP 3 — Signing (Email e-signature + ID upload)

User enters signer emails (if not known).

System sends:

Signature link

ID upload request

Summary of obligations

UI updates status:

Grey: pending invitation

Yellow: signature requested

Green: signed

Real-time updates appear on screen.

STEP 4 — Activation

Once all required signatures are complete:

Document becomes Active

Turns Green in library

Cannot be edited

Agent calls post_activation_hook:

Pre-Founder Agreement → update roles, vesting

NDA → mark confidentiality allowed

IP Assignment → set IP status to “clean”

SAFE → update cap table + investor state

Incorporation docs → set company status to “incorporated”

STEP 5 — Remembering (Qdrant semantic memory)

System:

Chunks final document

Embeds into Qdrant

Stores metadata:

doc_id

doc_type

company_id

section headings

Generates fact summary + stores in memory

These become queryable when user asks questions.

Examples:

“What’s our vesting schedule?”
AI retrieves vesting clauses.

“Who owns IP?”
AI retrieves IPAssignment facts.

⭐ 4. SPECIALIZED AGENTS (One Per Document Type)

Each DocumentAgent contains:

doc_type

Templates

Required fields

Validation rules

Drafting prompt

Summarization prompt

Post-activation logic

Examples:

NDAAgent

Required: Parties, effective date

Post-activation: allow sharing confidential info

PreFounderAgent

Required: founder list, roles, vesting, commitments

Post-activation: update founder state

IPAssignmentAgent
